# webseminars

This was an independent student initiative at the School of Electrical & Computer
Engineering in Aristotle University of Thessaloniki from October 2011 to February 2012.

The seminars included acquiring knowledge in the area of web programming, using
and combining technologies, such as XHTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, PHP, mySQL
and Apache configuration. In total, the seminars had a duration of 40 hours, while
an additional time of personal occupation for familiarization with and penetration of
the above technologies was essential, in order to fully utilize them in the context of
individual practical assignments and one final cooperative project.
